      <h2>Who is Tiger?</h2>
      <p class="actor5">Tiger(Salman Khan) is a man forged in the shadows â€” a RAW agent whose life has always belonged to duty, silence, and sacrifice. But everything changes when he meets Zoya. In the midst of a mission, he discovers a feeling stronger than orders: love. And with it, a new kind of courage.

        Faced with the impossible choice between allegiance to his nation and loyalty to his heart, Tiger chooses love â€” not as an escape, but as a declaration of who he truly is. He walks away from the agency that shaped him to stand beside the woman who awakened his soul.
        
        Through every chapter, Tiger evolves â€” not just as a soldier, but as a man. His love for Zoya doesnâ€™t weaken him. It strengthens him. In a world built on conflict, Tigerâ€™s greatest fight is not on the battlefieldâ€¦ itâ€™s to protect the family they built together, against all odds.

      <h2>Who is Zoya?</h2>
      <p class="actor5">Zoya(Katrina Kaif) is a force of quiet strength â€” a skilled ISI agent with sharp instincts and unshakable resolve. But beneath the mission reports and coded orders, she is a woman of fierce independence and deep emotion.

        When love crosses her path in the form of an enemy agent, she does the unthinkable. She leaves everything â€” her agency, her country, her past â€” to follow a path dictated not by politics, but by the heart. Not out of weakness, but out of immense strength.
        
        Zoyaâ€™s love for Tiger isn't soft or fragile â€” it's bold, unwavering, and rooted in shared risks and relentless hope. Together, they build a life not defined by flags or lines on a map, but by trust, respect, and the family they fight for.
        
        In every mission, Zoya proves that love is not a distraction â€” itâ€™s her driving force. A power that makes her more than an agent, more than a motherâ€¦ it makes her unstoppable.</p>
